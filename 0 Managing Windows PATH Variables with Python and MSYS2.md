# Managing Windows PATH Variables with Python and MSYS2

This script provides a set of utilities to manage and manipulate Windows `PATH` environment variables, making it easier to handle both **Windows-native paths** and **MSYS2/Unix-style paths**. It is especially useful when working in hybrid environments where tools from both Windows and MSYS2 are needed.

## 1. Retrieving Environment Variables from the Registry

The function **`get_env_path`** reads the `Path` variable from the Windows Registry:

* It supports both **user-level** (`HKEY_CURRENT_USER`) and **system-level** (`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE`) registry keys.
* If the `Path` entry is missing, an error message is logged to `stderr`.

This low-level approach ensures accuracy compared to relying only on `os.environ`.

## 2. Combining User and System PATH Variables

The function **`get_combined_path_list`**:

* Retrieves both user and system `PATH` values.
* Splits them into lists by semicolons (`;`).
* Optionally expands environment variables like `%SystemRoot%`.
* Combines them into one list, with **system paths first** and **user paths second**.

This merged list reflects the effective search order used by Windows.

## 3. Classifying PATH Entries

The function **`split_path`** organizes directories into two groups:

* **Prepend paths**: Directories containing executables like `python.exe` or `pip.exe`.
* **Append paths**: All other directories, excluding `WindowsApps` (which is skipped to avoid conflicts).

This ensures Python-related tools take priority while keeping other entries available.

## 4. Converting to MSYS2-Compatible Paths

The function **`win_to_msys`** uses **`cygpath.exe`** (part of MSYS2) to convert Windows-style paths like:

```
C:\Users\Example\bin
```

into MSYS2-style paths:

```
/c/Users/Example/bin
```

This step is crucial when passing environment variables from Windows to Unix-like shells.

---

## 5. Main Execution Flow

When executed as a script:

1. It prints the combined PATH list.
2. Splits the list into prepend and append groups.
3. Converts both groups into MSYS2 paths.
4. Outputs shell-style `PATH` exports that can be used in MSYS2 or other Unix-like environments.

For example:

```bash
PATH="/c/Python39:/c/Python39/Scripts:$PATH"
PATH="$PATH:/c/Windows/System32:/c/Program Files/Git/bin"
```

This provides a seamless bridge between Windows executables and MSYS2-based tools.

---

✅ **In summary**, this script acts as a **bridge between Windows and MSYS2 environments**, ensuring PATH variables are retrieved, cleaned up, prioritized, and converted into a format usable across both systems. It’s a practical utility for developers who frequently switch between Windows and Unix-like tools.
